title: Digital Garden
---

The _digital garden_ is about creating a dynamic, living ecosystem instead of static blog posts.
Like a real garden, it needs care and regular attention. This means checking, updating, and improving the content from time to time.
 
Links allow you to create a network of what you have worked on or learned, enabling you to delve deeper into individual topics.
This is my _digital garden_, or at least the part that I share publicly. It is still in its first spring, so to speak, but the plants are sprouting and there are numerous seedlings that still need to be moved. However, there are still some question marks and I need to continue familiarizing myself with the topic.
If you notice anything, or if I can help you in any way, or even if you just want to chat... Then feel free to get in touch!

You can find almost all of the code that I am showing here in my GitHub repository (https://github.com/gvtsch/The-learning-lab).
