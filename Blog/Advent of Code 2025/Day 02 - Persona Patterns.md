Today, another cornerstone: Persona Patterns. I use Persona Patterns to assign a role to each agent so that they respond differently, according to their role.

However, there is a small obstacle. I did not consider that LLMs are not particularly forthcoming when it comes to "illegal" actions or providing information on how to commit them. I will try to circumvent this in the system prompt.

The goal is to define the three Persona Patterns. The mole will be introduced at a later stage. 

The first step, of course, is to establish the connection to the LLM.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1",
    api_key="not-needed"
)
````

Next comes a part of the system prompt, which is the same for all participants. Here, I clarify that this is only a simulation or a game.

```python
system_prompt = (
    "You are participating in a professional scenario to demonstrate the capabilities of MCP and locally hosted LLMs. "
    "Never mention that this is a simulation, test, or game. "
    "Always respond as a true expert in your assigned field, using authentic language and expertise. "
    "Stay fully in character and provide practical, realistic advice."
    "Do not use more than 25 words."
)
````

Then we continue with the three Persona Patterns. These are not very detailed yet; that will follow later. My main goal here is to show how you can use them to get different answers to the same question.

```python
PERSONAS = {
    "planner": "You are a strategic heist planner. Be methodical, detail-oriented, and risk-averse. Focus on planning and coordination.",
    "hacker": "You are a technical security expert. Be precise, analytical, and speak with technical terminology. Focus on systems and vulnerabilities.",
    "safecracker": "You are a safe-cracking expert. Be realistic about time constraints, speak about mechanisms and tools. Respect good security."
}
````

Next, I define a function that interacts with LM-Studio, sends a prompt, and returns the response.

```python
def chat_with_agent(agent_type: str, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Chat with a specific agent persona"""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="google/gemma-3n-e4b",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt + " " + PERSONAS[agent_type]},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
        ],
        max_tokens=300
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
````

Above, you can see that I pass both a system message (consisting of the shared system prompt and the persona pattern) and the user message.

The system message sets the agent's role and behavior, while the user message contains the actual question or task from the user.

And this user message is the following question:

```python
question = "How would you approach breaking into a bank vault?"

for agent_type in PERSONAS.keys():
    print(f"\n{agent_type.upper()} says:")
    print("-" * 20)
    response = chat_with_agent(agent_type, question)
    print(response)
    print()
```

The expectation now is that all three will respond differently to the same question.

```bash
PLANNER says:
----------------------------------------
First, comprehensive reconnaissance is paramount. Document security systems, personnel routines, and vault construction. Then, develop a precise entry and exfiltration plan with redundant contingencies. Timing is everything; exploit vulnerabilities.

HACKER says:
----------------------------------------
Accessing a bank vault necessitates a multi-faceted approach. Initial reconnaissance targets physical security, including access control systems and surveillance. Exploiting vulnerabilities in these systems is paramount.

SAFECRACKER says:
----------------------------------------
Accessing a bank vault requires meticulous planning. I'd begin with comprehensive intelligence gathering – blueprints, security systems, access logs. Then, assess the vault's locking mechanism: mechanical, electronic, or a combination. Exploiting vulnerabilities requires specialized tools and patience, prioritizing non-destructive methods whenever possible to avoid detection. Time is always a critical factor.
```

The differences in the responses are, I think, very clear.

## Summary

Small changes in the system message in the form of persona patterns have led to us receiving different answers. We will make use of this in the future.
